# Artista

Photographers on Instagram would like to offer their photos in print to their subscribers. 
Therefore we have developed a marketplace that makes it easy to upload photos and sell images. 
The marketplace is optimized for artists on Instagram. That's why there is a function that allows you to search for Instagram names. 
In addition to the marketplace function, there is also the possibility to rate pictures or write comments.

## Home View 

The user is not logged in. Therefore there is the possibility to log in or register via the login button. 
Nevertheless even an unregistered user can see all products.

## Home View for logged in Users

When a user is logged in, the login button changes to user information button. The dropdown menu offers the user functions like _logout_ or _visit profile_.
Furthermore a field appears which asks the user to upload his own pictures.

## Product Detail

To learn more about a product, you can open a detail view for each image. In the detail view, 
the visitor gets more information about the product, such as a product description. If the user who uploaded 
the picture opens the detail view of his picture, he can edit it.

## Cart

The shopping cart shows all products that have been added to the shopping cart. 
A shopping cart object is only created when the first product has been added to the shopping cart. 
In the shopping cart, all products are added together depending on the respective quantity so that the total costs are displayed correctly.

## UML

This UML-Diagram shows very simple the structure of the app. It is not complete, but should give a rough impression of the architecture.
